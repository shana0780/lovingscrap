Problem after upgrade to Prestashop 1.7.6.2.
I have 3 problems after the update
1. When I click on add an article to the cart, the cart is empty
2. Unable to click on the button "add a file" to change the image in the slider
3. Unable to add or remove something in the topmenu.  The topmenu doesn't appear on the website.
